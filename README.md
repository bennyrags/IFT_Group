2. Install Heroku CLI by typing `brew install heroku/brew/heroku` in Terminal
3. Authenticate by typing `heroku login` in Terminal

### Heroku Setup

Run the following commands from within your project folder.

1. In terminal, navigate to your project folder and type `heroku create`
2. Login in if prompted -- it might ask to open a browser
3. Type `git remote -v` to ensure it added successfully

Next, commit your changes and push them to Heroku:

```
git add .
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
git push heroku master
```

   > Note: You'll need to commit and push each time you make a change that you want to deploy to Heroku.

   > Note: It is best to fully test your code locally before deploying to Heroku. Bugs are much harder to troubleshoot on a live website.

git commit -m "MESSAGE"
git push heroku master

Lastly, open terminal and type `heroku open` as a shortcut to open your website in a browser.
